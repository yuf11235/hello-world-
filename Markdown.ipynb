    "\n",
    "> Pardon my French\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quoting code\n",
    "##### You can call out code or a command within a sentence with single backticks. The text within the backticks will not be formatted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use `git status` to list all new or modified files that haven't yet been committed.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### To format code or text into its own distinct block, use triple backticks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some basic Git commands are:\n",
    "```\n",
    "git status\n",
    "git add\n",
    "git commit\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## Creating and highlighting code blocks\n",
    "##### Share samples of code with fenced code blocks and enabling syntax highlighting.\n",
    "### Fenced code blocks\n",
    "##### You can create fenced code blocks by placing triple backticks ``` before and after the code block. We recommend placing a blank line before and after code blocks to make the raw formatting easier to read.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "function test() {\n",
    "  console.log(\"notice the blank line before this function?\");\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Syntax highlighting\n",
    "##### You can add an optional language identifier to enable syntax highlighting in your fenced code block.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, to syntax highlight Ruby code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```ruby\n",
    "require 'redcarpet'\n",
    "markdown = Redcarpet.new(\"Hello World!\")\n",
    "puts markdown.to_html\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Links\n",
    "##### You can create an inline link by wrapping link text in brackets [ ], and then wrapping the URL in parentheses ( ). You can also use the keyboard shortcut command + k to create a link.\n",
    "\n",
    "This site was built using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "## Section links\n",
    "##### You can link directly to a section in a rendered file by hovering over the section heading to expose the link:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Relative links\n",
    "##### You can define relative links and image paths in your rendered files to help readers navigate to other files in your repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### A relative link is a link that is relative to the current file. For example, if you have a README file in root of your repository, and you have another file in docs/CONTRIBUTING.md, the relative link to CONTRIBUTING.md in your README might look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "[Contribution guidelines for this project](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### GitHub will automatically transform your relative link or image path based on whatever branch you're currently on, so that the link or path always works. You can use all relative link operands, such as ./ and ../.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Relative links are easier for users who clone your repository. Absolute links may not work in clones of your repository - we recommend using relative links to refer to other files within your repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lists\n",
    "##### You can make an unordered list by preceding one or more lines of text with - or *.\n",
    "- George Washington\n",
    "- John Adams\n",
    "- Thomas Jefferson\n",
    "##### To order your list, precede each line with a number.\n",
    "1. James Madison\n",
    "2. James Monroe\n",
    "3. John Quincy Adams\n",
    "### Nested Lists\n",
    "##### You can create a nested list by indenting one or more list items below another item.\n",
    "##### To create a nested list using the web editor on GitHub or a text editor that uses a monospaced font, like Atom, you can align your list visually. Type space characters in front of your nested list item, until the list marker character (- or *) lies directly below the first character of the text in the item above it.\n",
    "1. First list item\n",
    "   - First nested list item\n",
    "     - Second nested list item\n",
    "\n",
    "##### To create a nested list in the comment editor on GitHub, which doesn't use a monospaced font, you can look at the list item immediately above the nested list and count the number of characters that appear before the content of the item. Then type that number of space characters in front of the nested list item.\n",
    "##### In this example, you could add a nested list item under the list item 100. First list item by indenting the nested list item a minimum of five spaces, since there are five characters (100.) before First list item.\n",
    "100. First list item\n",
    "     - First nested list item\n",
    "\n",
    "##### You can create multiple levels of nested lists using the same method. For example, because the first nested list item has seven spaces (␣␣␣␣␣-␣) before the nested list content First nested list item, you would need to indent the second nested list item by seven spaces.\n",
    "100. First list item\n",
    "     - First nested list item\n",
    "       - Second nested list item\n",
    "       \n",
    "##### For more examples, see the [GitHub Flavored Markdown Spec]( https://github.github.com/gfm/#example-265).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task lists\n",
    "#####To create a task list, preface list items with a regular space character followed by [ ]. To mark a task as complete, use [x].\n",
    "\n",
    "- [x] Finish my changes\n",
    "- [ ] Push my commits to GitHub\n",
    "- [ ] Open a pull request\n",
    "##### For more information, see \"[About task lists](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-task-lists).\"\n",
